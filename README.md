# Description
This repository holds material of a project for algal bloom identification from optical satellite data (Sentinel-2 MSI) based on data from lakes and ponds in the Baltic states. 

# Data
The annotated dataset is available in the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ns5XHnfo-grdVcRthYl9evpd4-C1m5Xz?usp=sharing). 

# Code
A code in the file (Code_for_data_retrieval_from_GEE.ipynb) decribes how to retrieve Sentinel-2 data for one lake and for many lakes. An example is based on downloading data for 357 lakes and ponds in Lithuania. The code holds names of the measurement sites, reflectance in Sentinel-2 bands and additional radiometric indices that can be used for prediction of algal blooms. The column "bloom" defines whether the lake is blooming (1) or not (0).

## Funding information
The project was funded by young researchers grant (Nr. MSF-JM-7/2021) from Vilnius university Research promotion fund.
